	B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p), 8 points 7 rings
	deprotonated monomers have same backbone charges as protonated
	charges of head and tail monomers are from QM calculation of head and tail monomers 
PAAavg.lib:gas phase
        B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p), 8 points 7 rings
	deprotonated monomers have same backbone charges as protonated
	averaging charges over atom types 

For below libraries
	backbone charges are distinct between deprot and prot. monomers
	charges of head and tail monomers are derived from the middle monomer, small adjustments on charges of HA or HC
